**`Software Developer Wannabe, Music Lover (Play Coding like guitar)`**
Hey there! I'm a computer science student passionating about creating dope front-end designs. I love to make things look fancy ass and bring them to life with my coding skills. When I'm not working on projects, you can find me listening to music, as I'm a music lover and even enjoy beatboxing in my free time. I approach coding like a musician approaches their instrument, playing the strings of code to make something beautiful. So join me on this journey of combining the art of music and the science of coding, one line at a time.
